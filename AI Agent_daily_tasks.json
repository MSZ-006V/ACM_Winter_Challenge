    "Task 1": "Topic 1: Introduction to AI Agents \n\nTask Description: \nYour task is to gain a foundational understanding of what Artificial Intelligence (AI) Agents are. This includes learning about the conceptual framework of AI agents including the definition of an agent in an AI context, types of AI agents (simple reflex, model-based reflex, goal-based and utility-based), and how they perceive their environment and make decisions. \n\nEstimated Time to Complete: \nApproximately 10-15 hours. This can vary depending on your current familiarity with the subject. \n\nRecommended Resources: \n1. Book: \"Artificial Intelligence: Structures and Strategies for Complex Problem Solving\" by George F. Luger.\n2. Video: Lecture series on AI by Prof. Patrick Winston, MIT OpenCourseWare. \n3. Website: AI Topic notes on \u2018Agents and Environments\u2019 on Stanford\u2019s Introduction to AI Course website.\n\nTopic 2: Learning Algorithms for AI Agents\n\nTask Description: \nYour task is to understand the concept of learning algorithms that are used in AI agents. This would include gaining knowledge on the functionality of algorithms like reinforcement learning, unsupervised learning, supervised learning, and semi-supervised learning. Also, understanding key concepts like overfitting, underfitting, bias-variance tradeoff and cross-validation is needed.\n\nEstimated Time to Complete: \nApproximately 15-20 hours. This estimate can vary depending on your current familiarity with algorithms and your speed of learning.\n\nRecommended Resources:\n1. Book: \"Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective\" by Kevin P. Murphy.\n2. Video: Machine Learning Course by Andrew Ng on Coursera.\n3. Website: AI Topic notes on 'Learning Algorithms' on the University of Cambridge's Machine Learning and Real-world Data course website."
