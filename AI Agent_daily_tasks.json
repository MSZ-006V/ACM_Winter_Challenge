    "Task 1": "Topic 1: Understanding the Basics of AI Agents\n\nTask Description: This task will involve gaining a thorough understanding of what an AI agent is, its core principles, and its various subtypes. You need to focus on knowing how AI agents perceive their environment, the means through which AI agents take actions based on their perceptions, and the overall goal-orientation of AI agents. \n\nEstimated Time to Complete: Approximately 6 to 8 hours, divided into multiple sessions.\n\nRecommended Resources: \n1. Russell, S. and Norvig, P. \"Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach\". This book should provide you with a comprehensive understanding of AI agents.\n2. Video lectures provided by the University of California, Berkeley on YouTube, specifically regarding AI agents.\n3. The MIT OpenCourseWare website, which contains plenty of course materials on Artificial Intelligence. Look for sessions on Intelligent Agents.\n\nTopic 2: Agent Architectures in AI\n\nTask Description: This task requires a comprehensive study of different agent architectures in artificial intelligence. Start by understanding the basics of agent architectures, then delve into specific architectures like reactive, belief-desire-intention, layered learning, and blackboard systems. Understand their strengths, weaknesses, and specific application areas.\n\nEstimated Time to Complete: Approximately 8 to 10 hours, divided into multiple sessions.\n\nRecommended Resources:\n1. Russell, S., and Norvig, P. \"Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach\". There are dedicated sections on agent architectures in this book.\n2. Marie desJardins' lecture on \"Agent Architectures and Hierarchical Control\" available on YouTube.\n3. Notes and presentations on agent architectures available on the University of Southern California's website, specifically Craig Knoblock's \"Building Software Agents: An Overview\"."
