    "Task 1": "Learning the basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP)\n\n1. Task 1: Introduction to NLP: Search for resources on the internet then read and understand what NLP is, its applications, and why it is important in today's artificially intelligent world. Aim to understand the overview of the field. \n\n2. Task 2: Basic concepts: Learn about some basic concepts like Tokenization, Normalization, Stemming, Lemmatization, POS tagging, Named Entity Recognition, etc.\n\n3. Task 3: Install necessary Python libraries for NLP: Download and install Python on your PC, then use pip to install necessary libraries including but not limited to NLTK, spaCy, Gensim, etc.\n\n4. Task 4: Text Preprocessing: Understand the basic tasks of text preprocessing such as removing stop words, lower casing, punctuation removal, etc. Try to implement these using Python.\n\n5. Task 5: Start an introductory course: Start an online course that introduces NLP well e.g. Natural Language Processing in Python course from Coursera or Stanford's NLP Course. Watch the first few videos carefully.\n\n6. Task 6: Introduction to Corpora and Vectors: Get to know the concept of corpora and what a corpus is. Also, learn about the term \"word vector\" and understand how it is used in NLP.\n\n7. Task 7: Hands-On: Try doing a basic project. For instance, try sentiment analysis on a simple dataset.\n\n8. Task 8: Reading - Read the first few chapters of the book \"Speech and Language Processing by Daniel Jurafsky & James H. Martin.\" This will give you a solid base.\n\n9. Task 9: Review and Recap: At the end of the day, review what you learned. Try explaining the concepts to someone else or summarizing them in writing. If stuck anywhere, seek help from online communities like Stack Overflow or Reddit.\n\n10. Task 10: Set goals for the next day: Now that you are familiar with basic NLP concepts and have your hands set on a few libraries, plan what advanced topics or concepts you would like to learn the following day e.g. Word Embeddings, Sequencing Modeling, etc."
